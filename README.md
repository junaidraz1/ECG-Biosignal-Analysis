🫀 Analyzing an ECG Signal Step-by-Step
🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of analyzing ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals, aimed at understanding the fundamental steps involved in processing and interpreting heart rate data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide for developers and researchers interested in ECG analysis, from signal acquisition to feature extraction and visualization.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered
ECG Signal Processing: Preprocessing techniques like noise removal and filtering.
Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features like heart rate, R-peaks, etc.
Visualization: Plotting the ECG signal for better interpretation.
Machine Learning (Optional): Using extracted features to train models for heart condition prediction.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 🐍
NumPy 🔢 (For numerical operations)
Matplotlib 📊 (For visualization)
SciPy 🔬 (For signal processing)
BioSPPy 🧬 (For biosignal processing)
🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
ECG Signal Acquisition: Collect raw ECG data from devices like ECG sensors or databases.
Preprocessing: Clean the signal by removing noise using filters (e.g., Bandpass).
R-Peak Detection: Detect R-peaks using algorithms like Pan-Tompkins to identify heartbeats.
Heart Rate Calculation: Measure heart rate by analyzing the intervals between R-peaks.
Visualization: Plot the ECG signal to visualize heartbeats and other characteristics.
Feature Extraction: Extract useful features (e.g., RR intervals, QRS complex) for further analysis or classification.
Optional - Machine Learning: Use features for classification tasks such as arrhythmia detection.
